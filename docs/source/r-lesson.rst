R and R Studio
==============


Objective
*********

Introduce and teach basic R usage with lessons from Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops. RStudio and R (v3.4.4) are already installed on the VCL image. If you log in using a Remote Desktop connection, you can find RStudio under the Applications menu in the Devlopment category. If you normally log into a VCL instance using SSH, then you have a choice of either using R in the terminal window on the VCL instance, or using RStudio running on the laptop that you use to connect to the VCL. The Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry tutorials are written with the assumption that you will be using RStudio, so if you choose to work in a terminal through SSH to the VCL, you will not be able to carry out all the exercises in the tutorials.
